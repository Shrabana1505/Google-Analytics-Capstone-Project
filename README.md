## Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This repository contains the full analysis and final report for the **Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study**. The goal of this project is to identify key behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **annual members**, and to propose data-driven strategies to increase annual memberships.

## 📌 Project Overview

Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, wants to convert more casual riders into annual members. This analysis explores ride patterns, seasonal trends, station usage, ride duration, and temporal behavior using Divvy’s public Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 datasets.

The repository includes:

* The **official case study brief (PDF)** outlining the business problem and objectives
* A **professional final report** (HTML + PDF)
* A **detailed analysis notebook** documenting the full workflow
* All supporting files for reproducibility ( LaTeX preamble)

## 🧠 Key Findings

* **Casual riders take longer rides**, especially on weekends.
* **Members ride during weekday peak hours**, reflecting commute behavior.
* **Casual usage surges in warmer months**, while member usage is stable year-round.
* **Casual riders start near tourist/scenic locations**; members start near business and transit hubs.
* **Round trips** are more common for casual riders, while members take point-to-point commuter trips.

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Seasonal Membership Campaign (Late April–July)**

   * Promote leisure-focused perks like ride discounts and scenic-station benefits.

2. **Public Transport Advertising (May–September)**

   * Display QR-code based ads inside buses, trains, and metro stations near tourist zones.

3. **Extra Ride-Time Benefits for Annual Members**

   * Offer bonus ride minutes or extended ride duration to attract long-ride casual users.
